#
# The guard has two halves, because the binaries split into two build models:
#   • privacy_box + the app server + millfolio ship PREBUILT — their (CPU-only)
#     packagers `mojo build` them, so a vendoring gap (the v0.4.30/runqueue class
#     of bug) fails inside `package_bundle.sh` HERE, before the tag. We then assert
#     those three binaries are actually in the bundle.
#   • the engine ships SOURCE and is compiled ON-DEVICE — its AOT GPU/Metal kernels
#     can't build on the GPU-less GitHub CI runner ("Unknown GPU architecture
#     detected"). So THIS local, GPU-equipped preflight is the ONLY place its full
#     bundle compile is exercised: we run the installer's exact `mojo build` against
#     the extracted engine source (catches a missing jinja2/flare vendoring gap).
#
# Slow (builds the engine + app web, then compiles) — that's the point; releases
# are rare and a broken one is expensive. Needs the dev pixi envs.
