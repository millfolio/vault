"""Egress-test — prove the EgressGuard actually blocks. `pixi run egress-test`.

The guard is privacy_box's confidentiality chokepoint. This is the test that makes
"confidential" true rather than nominal: a clean payload passes, but a payload
carrying a real-data fingerprint OR a canary token is blocked (the guard raises,
so transport aborts the send).
