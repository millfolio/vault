"""Orchestrator — privacy_box's core loop (pi's `pi-agent-core` equivalent).

VAULT-ONLY. Wires the layers into the privacy flow (README.md):

  1. `veilens manifest` produces the ALIASED view (the only vault info the remote
     model sees — never a real name, value, or path).
  2. RemoteClient.codegen writes a `from vault import *` program from that (every
     outbound message passes the EgressGuard — confidentiality enforced here).
  3. compile it (with the veilens include paths), looping the fix on COMPILE
     errors only; the code is in terms of aliases, so there is no dealias step.
  4. run the program in the loopback Sandbox over REAL data; only the printed
     answer surfaces. search()/ask_local() reach 127.0.0.1 only.

See run_vault_task for the full confidentiality argument.

        This is the existing confidentiality model extended from "read one CSV" to
        "use the vault tools". The CONFIDENTIALITY INVARIANT, held end to end:

          - The ONLY vault information that reaches the remote (frontier) model is
            the ALIASED manifest (`file_0 [csv] 130 bytes  schema: col_0, col_1`)
            produced by `veilens manifest` — aliases/kinds/sizes/aliased columns,
            never a real name, value, or path (see veilens/src/manifest.mojo).
          - The question is the user's to send; the data is not. Every outbound
            message still passes the EgressGuard inside codegen()/fix_code()
            (fails closed) — a real value leaking into the manifest would trip it.
          - The generated program is written in terms of ALIASES (the tools TAKE
            aliases and resolve them locally), so there is NO dealias step — and
            nothing real is ever injected into the code (unlike the CSV path).
          - The program runs locally; search()/ask_local() hit ONLY 127.0.0.1
            (the loopback-only run profile, privacy_box-vault.sb.template, denies all
            other network); the answer is printed locally and returned here.

        So: aliases out, code back, run local over real data, answer local. The
        real content is touched only by the on-device tools, never the frontier.

        directly to stream status/debug and gate the run on user approval."""
